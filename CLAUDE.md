## Project Purpose
GroveAssistant is a Firefox browser extension that provides personalized style analysis and outfit suggestions for clothing products on e-commerce sites (starting with Uniqlo). Uses Claude AI models for analysis with prompt caching optimization, tracks API costs, and offers both personalized and basic modes.

**Internal Codename:** Style Goblin

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Firefox WebExtension (Manifest V3) |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) |
| Database | SQLite (async via aiosqlite) |
| AI | Claude API (Sonnet 4.5 + Haiku 4.5) |
| Image Processing | Pillow (WebP conversion) |
| Package Manager | UV (Python), npm (Extension) |
| Validation | Pydantic |

## Architecture Notes
### AI Provider Abstraction
- Base `AIProvider` class allows swapping between Claude, LM Studio, OpenRouter, OpenAI
- `ClaudeProvider` implements 3-breakpoint prompt caching (50-70% cost savings)
- Profile versioning with SHA-256 hash for cache invalidation

### Key Patterns
- **Prompt Caching**: User profile and extraction schema cached to minimize costs
- **Two-Mode Operation**: Full personalized (Sonnet) vs. basic analysis (Haiku)
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-session and all-time tracking with model breakdown
- **Product Caching**: SQLite stores analyzed products keyed to profile version hash
- **DOM Injection**: Primary strategy with floating overlay fallback
- **Image Optimization**: Product images converted to WebP, compressed to ~200KB

## Essential Instructions (Always Follow)

### Core Behavior
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

### Naming Conventions
- **Directories**: Use CamelCase (e.g., `VideoProcessor`, `AudioTools`, `DataAnalysis`)
- **Date-based paths**: Use skewer-case with YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `logs-2025-01-15`, `backup-2025-12-31`)
- **No spaces or underscores** in directory names (except date-based paths)

### TODO Management
- **Always check `TODOS.md` first** when starting a task or session
- **Update immediately** when tasks are completed, added, or changed
- Keep the list current and manageable

### Git Workflow Essentials

**After completing major changes, you MUST commit your work.**

**Conventional Commits Format:**
```bash
<type>: <brief description>

<optional body>

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Common Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Examples:**
```bash
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Correct timezone bug
docs: Update README
```

## Quick Reference

### Security Basics
- Store API keys in `secrets.json` (NEVER commit)
- Add `secrets.json` to `.gitignore` immediately
- Provide `secrets_template.json` for setup
- Use environment variables as fallbacks

### House Agents Quick Trigger
**When searching 20+ files**, use house-research for:
- Finding patterns across codebase
- Searching TODO/FIXME comments
- Locating API endpoints or functions
- Documentation searches

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Function & Variable Naming
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages
- Never let errors fail silently

### File Organization
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use consistent import ordering:
  1. Standard library
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Local imports
- Keep configuration separate from logic

---

## Communication Style
- Be concise but thorough
- Explain reasoning for significant decisions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Proactively suggest improvements when appropriate
